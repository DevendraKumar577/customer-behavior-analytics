# Customer Shopping Behavior Analytics

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using real-world retail data to understand purchasing patterns, revenue contribution, and customer segmentation.  
The goal is to convert raw customer data into meaningful business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.


## Project Overview

Customer behavior plays a critical role in improving sales strategy, marketing decisions, and customer retention.  
In this project, I explored customer shopping data to answer questions like:

- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- How does customer behavior vary across age groups?
- What percentage of customers are subscribed?
- Which segments contribute the highest sales?

The analysis is supported by an interactive Power BI dashboard for clear visualization and decision-making.


##  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **SQL** (data querying & aggregation)
- **Power BI** (interactive dashboard & KPIs)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (analysis workflow)
- **Excel / CSV** (raw data source)




## Power BI Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard provides a high-level and detailed view of customer behavior:

- Total number of customers
- Average purchase amount
- Average customer rating
- Revenue & sales by category
- Sales & revenue by age group
- Subscription status distribution
- Interactive filters (Gender, Category, Shipping Type)



## Key Insights

- **Clothing** is the highest revenue and sales-contributing category.
- **Young Adults** generate the maximum revenue among all age groups.
- A majority of customers are **non-subscribers**, indicating growth potential for subscription plans.
- Accessories and footwear show consistent mid-level performance.


## Business Value

This project demonstrates how customer data can be used to:

- Improve marketing targeting
- Identify high-value customer segments
- Optimize product category focus
- Support data-driven business decisions


## How to Use This Project

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook to view data cleaning and analysis steps.
2. Review SQL queries for business-level data extraction.
3. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard.
4. Use filters to interact with customer segments.
